Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

-Added a "Game Over" screen upon death when player hits an asteroid
-Player can press the "Restart" button to try again
-Player can now move left or right instead of strictly staying in the middle
-Added a ScoreManager script that keeps track of score whenever the player dodges the asteroids
-Added a background that scrolls horizontally
-Added a camera animator game component in Unity that triggers a slight shake whenever the player moves up and down

Room for Improvement for next milestone

-I attempted using the ObjectPool script of my own and I'm honestly having struggles with it
-The asteroids still do not disappear when they go off screen (having trouble with that)
-I'll add a power up mechanic where it has a meter and a cooldown whenever it is used once
-I'll add a title screen that includes instructions on how to play
-The "Game Over" screen doesn't keep track of score yet (working on that to fix)
